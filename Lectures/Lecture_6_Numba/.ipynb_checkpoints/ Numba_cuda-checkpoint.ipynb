    "- On the software side, the block size determines how many threads share a given area of shared memory.\n",
    "- On the hardware side, the block size must be large enough for full occupation of execution units; recommendations can be found in the CUDA C Programming Guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "The block size you choose depends on a range of factors, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The size of the data array\n",
    "- The size of the shared mempory per block (e.g. 64KB)\n",
    "- The maximum number of threads per block supported by the hardware (e.g. 512 or 1024)\n",
    "- The maximum number of threads per multiprocessor (MP) (e.g. 2048)\n",
    "- The maximum number of blocks per MP (e.g. 32)\n",
    "- The number of threads that can be executed concurrently (a “warp” i.e. 32)\n",
    "\n",
    "The execution of threads in a warp has a big effect on the computational throughput. If all threads in a warp are executing the same instruction then they can all be executed in parallel. But if one or more threads is executing a different instruction, the warp has to be split into groups of threads, and these groups execute serially.\n",

In the example above, you could make blockspergrid and threadsperblock tuples of one, two or three integers.
